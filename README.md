# entrokitty

It gives you random cat names so you can tell files apart, it's much easier than trying to tell git hashes apart.

## CLI Usage

```
npm install -g entrokitty
```

Now just type `entrokitty` to get a random cat name.


## Node Usage

```javascript
var entrokitty = require('entrokitty');

console.log(entrokitty()); // Mew Kabakoff or one of many other cat names.
```
